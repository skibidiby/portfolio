      Welcome to my personal <span class="violet">portfolio</span>!
    </h2>
    <p class="text-normal">
      I have no idea how you landed here, but it's nice to meet you! I am a
      creative person with a burning passion about technologies and programming.
      I have professional experience in Web development mainly in React.js but
      in my spare time I love to work on personal projects with a wide variety
      of different tools.
    </p>
    <p class="text-normal">
      I‚Äôm always eager to explore new frameworks, languages, and methodologies
      to push my skills further. Whether it‚Äôs building interactive front-end
      experiences, optimizing back-end performance, or experimenting with AI and
      automation, I enjoy the challenge of turning ideas into reality.
    </p>
    <p class="text-normal">
      Beyond coding, I have a deep appreciation for design, UX principles, and
      creating seamless user experiences. I believe that well-crafted software
      is a perfect blend of functionality and aesthetics.
    </p>
    <p class="text-normal">
      When I‚Äôm not behind my keyboard, you‚Äôll probably find me listening to
      music, reading books or drinking beer with mates üç∫
